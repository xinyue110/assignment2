Covering an area of approximately 23kmÂ², it is comprised of 9 subzones, with the majority of the area designated for residential purposes, except for three subzones in the south and a portion of industrial land in the north. Let us now take a brief look at the current status of educational land in Yishun, its existing plans, and the potential challenges it may face in the future!',
